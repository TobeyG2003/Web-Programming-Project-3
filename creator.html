<p>SCRUM SUMMARY</p>
<p>SCRUM provided a structured framework for organizing our work and managing tasks.
Daily meetings helped us identify obstacles.
Personally, the obstacles like timeframe and how to collab and communicate is made more efficient.
SCRUM encouraged open communication and collaboration among team members.</p>
In the future, this methodology SCRUM will continue to be beneficial as it provides a scalable framework that can be adapted to various projects.
By implementing SCRUM practices, teams can improve productivity, deliver higher-quality products, and better meet customer expectations.
