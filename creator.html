<p>PROJECT NAME: Real Estate Kings</p>
<p>Role: Home page, Registration, DB setup & Encryption/Decryption</p>
<p>SCRUM SUMMARY</p>
<p>SCRUM methodology was beneficial in the way that it made communication very frequent and organized, which is an essential component for teamwork and team building, in addition to setting a
  good framwork for the planning stages of the project. Not only did it allow for an easy understanding the progress made on the project in respect to the given timeframe, but it also made sure that
the team was very clear with eachother in understanding what one member required from another or helping solve any issues encountered on their end. This methodology will be beneficial to me in the future
since it present an easy format and workflow for team-based projects, which are a common and inevitable aspect of not only later classes, but many assignments in the computer science field.</p>

<p>SCRUM SUMMARY</p>
<p>SCRUM provided a structured framework for organizing our work and managing tasks.
Daily meetings helped us identify obstacles.
Personally, the obstacles like timeframe and how to collab and communicate is made more efficient.
SCRUM encouraged open communication and collaboration among team members.</p>
In the future, this methodology SCRUM will continue to be beneficial as it provides a scalable framework that can be adapted to various projects.
By implementing SCRUM practices, teams can improve productivity, deliver higher-quality products, and better meet customer expectations.

<p>Role: Seller DashBoard functions
<p>SCRUM SUMMARY</p>
<p></p>

<h2>TEST CASES</h2>
email - email@test, pass - testpass --> This will result in a successful login, but present errors if used for registration because it already exists. It does not access the Seller's board since its a buyer account.<br>
For registration, you can type in whatever you like provided it fits the format and passes the validation, make sure to set the role to seller to access the seller dash. Use the same details to log in. Non-matching details will result in login fail<br>
For a fail test case, use the above email and/or username test which will result in an error and not register an account.
